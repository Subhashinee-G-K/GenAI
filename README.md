# IMAGE NOISE REDUCTION USING AUTOENCODER

# Overview

The project aims to develop an image denoising algorithm using convolutional autoencoders, focusing on enhancing image quality and facilitating accurate analysis. It involves preprocessing the MNIST dataset, introducing noise to simulate real-world scenarios, designing and training a convolutional autoencoder model, evaluating its performance using both visual inspection and quantitative metrics, and deploying it for real-world denoising tasks. The project's overarching goal is to provide a robust framework for addressing noise-related challenges in diverse applications, ultimately improving user experience and enabling more informed decision-making processes.
